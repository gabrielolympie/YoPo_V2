    "A trigger is a mechanism that determines when a neuron should be fired or activated. It is a conditional check that evaluates certain criteria, such as the state of the neuron's buffer messages or the time elapsed since the last firing. If the condition is met, the trigger returns a list of predecessors that are ready to be fired, otherwise it returns None. The purpose of a trigger is to control the flow of information and activation of neurons in a neural network or other complex system. In the provided examples, we see two types of triggers:"

    "## The Brain class enables you to orchestrate several neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of a Brain\n",
    "A Brain represents a neural network that can execute conversations. The Brain class has methods to run the brain execution synchronously and yield the list of messages each time a process is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Brain\n",
    "A Brain consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Name**: A unique name for the brain.\n",
    "2. **Neurons**: A list of neurons in the brain, where each neuron is an instance of the `Neuron` class.\n",
    "3. **Working Memory**: A working memory that stores messages and has a maximum size and overflow strategy.\n",
    "4. **Workers**: The number of worker threads used to execute the brain.\n",
    "5. **Timeout**: The timeout for the brain execution.\n",
    "6. **Iteration Delay**: The delay between iterations.\n",
    "7. **Max Concurrent Fires**: The maximum number of concurrent fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Brain\n",
    "To create a Brain, you can use the `Brain` class and provide the required attributes. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "brain = Brain(\n",
    "    name=\"my_brain\",\n",
    "    neurons=[neuron_1, neuron_2, neuron_3],\n",
    "    max_working_memory_size=10000,\n",
    "    working_memory_overflow_strategy=\"fifo\",\n",
    "    workers=8,\n",
    "    timeout=120,\n",
    "    iteration_delay=0.5,\n",
    "    max_concurrent_fires=100,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a Brain\n",
    "The `run` method is used to run the brain execution synchronously. It takes a conversation as input and yields the list of messages each time a process is finished. The conversation is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message with a role and content.\n"
